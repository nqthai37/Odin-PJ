        <li>Egg yolks: The traditional rich carbonara sauce is made with four egg yolks.</li>
        <li>Parmesan: You’ll need two cups of Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Heavy cream: Make sure the heavy cream is room temperature.</li>
        <li>Chicken: This recipe is a great use for leftover cooked chicken breast.</li>
        <li>Parsley: Fresh Italian parsley is optional, but it adds a nice pop of color and flavor</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the pancetta until lightly browned and crisp, then set aside.</li>
        <li>Boil spaghetti, reserve two cups of pasta water, and set aside.</li>
        <li>Whisk the eggs in a bowl, then whisk in 1 ½ cups of the hot pasta water.</li>

        <li>Transfer the mixture to a prepared baking dish and bake until the sauce is thickened.</li>
